        <h4>Quiz page</h4>
        <p>
          The Quiz page, I created an interactive quiz that displays one
          question at a time, with each question having a ten-second time limit.
          Users will select their answers, and the solutions will be verified in
          real-time. At the end of the quiz, your score will be displayed,
          showcasing your performance.
