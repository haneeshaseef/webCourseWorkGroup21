                    It has similarities to five-a-side football and indoor football. 
                    Futsal is played between two teams of five players each, one of whom is the goalkeeper. 
                    Unlimited substitutions are permitted.
                    It is played with a smaller, harder, lower-bounce ball than association football.

                    Street football is more similar to beach football and futsal than to association football. 
                    Often the most basic of set-ups will involve just a ball with a wall or fence used as a goal, 
                    or items such as clothing being used for goalposts (hence the phrase "jumpers for goalposts"). 
                    The phrase was used by Ed Sheeran in his 2015 documentary Jumpers for Goalposts: 
                    Live at Wembley Stadium.
