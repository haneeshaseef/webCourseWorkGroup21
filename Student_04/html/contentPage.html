        <p>In association football, a football club (or association football club, alternatively soccer club) is a sports club that acts as an entity through 
            which association football teams organise their sporting activities. The club can exist either as an independent unit or 
            as part of a larger sports organization by which it carries a parent-subsidiary stakeholdership.
            The sport of association football allows teams that partake in some sort of club activity to participate in tournaments such as leagues and other competitions. 
            Teams must register their players as well as staff and other personnel in order to be 
            eligible to represent the club in any activity as it regards to association football competitions.</p>

        <h2>Football Teams</h2>
        <p>
            There are several varieties of football, including association football, gridiron football, Australian rules football, 
            Gaelic football, rugby league and rugby union. The number of players selected for each team, within these varieties and 
            their associated codes, can vary substantially. Sometimes, the word "team" is limited to those who play on the field in a match 
            and does not always include other players who may take part as replacements or emergency players. "Football squad" may be used 
            to be inclusive of these support and reserve players. The words team and club are sometimes used interchangeably by supporters, 
            typically referring to the team within the club playing in the highest division or competition. 
            A football club is a type of sports club which is an organized or incorporated body. <br> Typically these will have a committee, 
            secretary, president or chairperson, registrar and members. Football clubs typically have a set of rules, including rules under 
            which they play and are themselves typically members of a league or association which are affiliated with a governing body within 
            their sport. Clubs may field multiple teams from their registered players (which may participate in several different divisions or 
            leagues). A club is responsible for ensuring the continued existence of its teams in their respective competitions. 
            The oldest football clubs date back to the early 19th century. While records exist for most incorporated clubs, 
            they do not exist for all football clubs. Standalone clubs are usually run like businesses and appear on official registers. 
            However many football clubs were formed as part of larger organisations (schools, athletic clubs, societies) and therefore public 
            records of their formation and operation may not be kept unless they compete with other teams. Football clubs may also be dormant 
            for periods and be re-formed (for example going into recess for reasons such as war or lack of a league or competition to 
            participate in) and even switch between football codes. Likewise, a football club may fold if it becomes insolvent or is incapable 
            of fielding a team to play matches.
